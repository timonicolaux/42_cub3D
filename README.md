## Description

This project is a graphic project in C progamming language, with the purpose of creating a game that looks like an old FPS, [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D).

The method of [Raycasting](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raycasting) must be used here + the graphic library MinilibX to render our game. Basically, we create a 3D environment using 2D graphics techniques.

Unfortunately, sharing the exercices subjects is forbidden by the school, but you may still be able to find these on the internet :)
